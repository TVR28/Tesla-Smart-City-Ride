# Tesla Smart City Ride

Tesla SmartRide aims to provide a real-time data streaming and visualization system for a Tesla vehicle traveling from Seattle to Cupertino. The system utilizes IoT devices to collect various data points such as vehicle information, GPS coordinates, and weather conditions. This data is processed and visualized in real time, leveraging a stack of Apache and AWS technologies.

## System Architecture

### Components

# Tesla SmartRide - Detailed Component Overview

## 1. IoT Devices:
   - IoT devices in the Tesla vehicles collect a myriad of data in real-time, which includes GPS tracking for location, various vehicle telemetry data to assess performance and condition, and emergency data to respond to critical situations promptly. These devices are crucial for gathering the raw data needed for further processing and insights.

## 2. Apache Zookeeper:
   - Apache Zookeeper plays a pivotal role in managing and synchronizing the distributed services within the ecosystem, specifically focusing on Kafka brokers. It helps maintain configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services to ensure that the Kafka cluster operates smoothly and consistently without data loss.

## 3. Apache Kafka:
   - Serving as the central hub for all data streams, Apache Kafka handles the ingestion of massive streams of data from multiple sources, including the IoT devices. It ensures efficient and reliable transfer of data between data producers (IoT devices) and data consumers (Apache Spark), capable of handling high-throughput and low-latency messaging.

## 4. Apache Spark:
   - Apache Spark consumes the data streamed by Kafka, processing it in real-time to perform complex analyses and calculations. The processed data is then pushed to AWS S3 for permanent storage. Spark's ability to handle live data streams makes it ideal for immediate data manipulation and aggregation needed in dynamic environments like smart cities.

## 5. AWS S3:
   - AWS S3 acts as the storage solution within the project, where all the processed data is stored. S3 provides a highly durable, scalable, and secure object storage which makes it perfect for storing large volumes of data that can be accessed and analyzed later for further insights.

## 6. AWS Glue and Data Catalog:
   - AWS Glue is used to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from AWS S3 into usable formats for analysis. Along with the Data Catalog—a metadata storage system—it organizes data into catalogs and makes it searchable, and readily available for querying and analytics, bridging the gap between raw data storage and actionable insights.

## 7. AWS Redshift/Athena:
   - AWS Redshift and Athena serve as the data warehousing and querying solutions respectively. Redshift provides a fast, fully managed data warehouse that makes it simple and cost-effective to analyze all your data using standard SQL and your existing Business Intelligence tools. Athena allows users to directly query the data stored in S3 using SQL, thus making it easier to perform ad-hoc analysis.

## 8. Visualization Tools (PowerBI, Tableau, Looker Studio):
   - These tools are intended to be implemented to enable the visualization of the processed data into interpretable and interactive dashboards. PowerBI, Tableau, and Looker Studio can transform the structured data into visually appealing reports and dashboards that provide actionable insights, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions based on the latest data.

## Data Flow

![Data Flow Diagram](path/to/dataflow/image.jpg)  <!-- Placeholder for data flow diagram -->

- Data collected by IoT devices in the Tesla is sent to Apache Kafka.
- Apache Spark consumes this streaming data from Kafka.
- The processed data is stored in AWS S3.
- AWS Glue transforms and catalogs the data, making it available for querying.
- Data is loaded into AWS Redshift or queried through Athena for further analysis.
- Final data visualizations are prepared in BI tools like PowerBI, Tableau, or Looker Studio.

## Installation and Configuration

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9.6
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- An active AWS account

### Setup Instructions

1. **Initial Setup**:
   Create `docker-compose.yml` to orchestrate Zookeeper and Kafka services:
   ```bash
   touch docker-compose.yml
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
2. **Create Spark Job Script:**
   ```bash
   touch jobs/spark-city.py
   ```
3. **Install Required Python Packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install confluent_kafka simplejson pyspark
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the Spark Application:**
   ```bash
   docker exec -it smartcity-spark-master-1 spark-submit \ --master spark://spark-master:7077 \ --packages org.apache.spark:spark-sql-kafka-0-10_2.12:3.5.0,org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-aws:3.3.1,com.amazonaws:aws-java-sdk:1.11.469 jobs/spark-city.py
   ```
5. **Monitoring the Application:**
   Access the Spark UI at `http://localhost:9090` to monitor the streaming process.
   

## Application Details

The Tesla SmartRide application captures and processes data in real-time to provide insights into vehicle performance, route optimization, and environmental conditions. This is critical for smart city projects where data-driven decisions can significantly affect both safety and efficiency.

## Future Work
- Implementing the visualization layer using PowerBI, Tableau, or Looker Studio.
- Enhancing data processing and analysis features.
