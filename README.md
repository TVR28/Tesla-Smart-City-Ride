## Project Overview

Tesla SmartRide aims to provide a real-time data streaming and visualization system for a Tesla vehicle traveling from Seattle to Cupertino. The system utilizes IoT devices to collect various data points such as vehicle information, GPS coordinates, and weather conditions. This data is processed and visualized in real time, leveraging a stack of Apache and AWS technologies.

## System Architecture

### Components

1. **IoT Devices**:
   - Collect real-time data from the vehicle, including GPS, vehicle status, and emergency data.

2. **Apache Zookeeper**:
   - Manages and synchronizes the distributed services, specifically Kafka brokers.

3. **Apache Kafka**:
   - Acts as the central hub for data streams, ensuring efficient data transfer between producers and consumers.

4. **Apache Spark**:
   - Consumes data from Kafka, processes it in real-time, and outputs to AWS S3 for storage.

5. **AWS S3**:
   - Stores the processed data which can then be used for further analysis or visualized.

6. **AWS Glue and Data Catalog**:
   - Extracts data from S3, structures it, and prepares it for querying and reporting.

7. **AWS Redshift/Athena**:
   - Data warehousing solutions for detailed analysis and querying of the structured data.

8. **Visualization Tools (PowerBI, Tableau, Looker Studio)**:
   - Used for creating dashboards and visual representations of the data. (To be implemented)

## Data Flow

![Data Flow Diagram](path/to/dataflow/image.jpg)  <!-- Placeholder for data flow diagram -->

- Data collected by IoT devices in the Tesla is sent to Apache Kafka.
- Apache Spark consumes this streaming data from Kafka.
- The processed data is stored in AWS S3.
- AWS Glue transforms and catalogs the data, making it available for querying.
- Data is loaded into AWS Redshift or queried through Athena for further analysis.
- Final data visualizations are prepared in BI tools like PowerBI, Tableau, or Looker Studio.

## Installation and Configuration

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9.6
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- An active AWS account

### Setup Instructions

1. **Initial Setup**:
   Create `docker-compose.yml` to orchestrate Zookeeper and Kafka services:
   ```bash
   touch docker-compose.yml
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
